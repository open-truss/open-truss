A user story is a tool we use to guide Open Truss development. It describes someone by listing out what they hope to achieve and why this will be helpful to them.

We use the following format for these:

```md
# Name
<!--
  Replace with clear concise label for the user in the story, e.g; an abuse analyst, a data scientist, a content labeler.
-->

## 1. Need One

<!--
  Describe the request/feature/outcome from the perspective of the user.
  At the beginning, this could be as large as a dashboard to review packages,
  but likely this is too large and should be broken into smaller stories: for
  example one piece of this could be written as needing to see a package's
  metadata and another could be to browse its code.
-->

<!--
  Succinct user stories (what we're calling needs) can usually fit the format "As a PERSONA I need FEATURE because of PROBLEM."
  To give ourselves more room we want, for each need, to:
    - Describe why they need it. This will be the problem(s) they face.
    - Loosely summarize what the solution might look like.
-->

## 2. Need Two

<!-- Same as above -->
```
