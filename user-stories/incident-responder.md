# Incident Responder

## 1. See a list of open alerts

When responding to an incident the first thing I need to do is see a list of open alerts. This will help me understand the scope of the incident and prioritize my response.

## 2. Pivot from an alert and list of services to the metrics for those services

When viewing an alert and list of services I need to pivot to the metrics for those services. This will help me understand the impact of the incident and how it is affecting the service.

## 3. Pivot from a list of services and to their owners

When viewing a service and it's metrics I need to pivot to the service owners. This will tell me who I need to contact to help resolve the incident.

## 4. Collect artifacts along the way

While working the incident I need to collect every artifact including urls, screenshots, commands I ran from a console and their output, and more. This will make it easier to share the incident with others and to learn from it later.
