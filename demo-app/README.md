# Model Home

Model Home is Open Truss's demo application to help showcase how to use OT and help develop the OT libraries. It is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project originally bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and `npm run ot:setup`.

## Getting Started

Install packages:

```bash
# In here (./demo-app)
npm install

# In packages/open-truss
npm install
```

Run the development server and build the OT library:

```bash
script/server
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Development

Model Home is a mix of Open Truss examples and research we're doing that has not yet been added to an `@open-truss` package.
